[Fugue](https://github.com/fugue-project/fugue) is a unified interface for distributed computing. Fugue executes SQL, Python, and Pandas code on Spark, Dask and Ray without any rewrites. I primarily write content, speak at conferences, and maintain the [tutorials](https://fugue-tutorials.readthedocs.io/).

[Prefect](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect) is a Python-based workflow orchestration management system that schedules and monitors data pipelines. I worked for a year and a couple months at Prefect focused on open-source support, developer education, and some small pull requests.
