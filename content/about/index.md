**Hello! ðŸ‘‹**

My name is Kevin Kho. I am currently working on [Fugue](https://github.com/fugue-project/fugue/), a minimal interface to bring Python, Pandas, and SQL code to Spark, Dask, and Ray. Most recently, I was at [Prefect](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect) as an Open Source Community Engineer where I managed the Slack community and created content. Before working on open-source tooling, I was a data scientist for four years across [Paylocity](https://www.paylocity.com/) and [Itron](https://www.itron.com/). 

I am currently contracting part time with [Citi](https://www.citi.com/) helping them scale compute workflows to distributed computing. I am looking for more contract opportunities around big data and machine learning platforms.

:mailbox_with_no_mail:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Contact me!**

Feel free to reach out to me for anything data related. I talk to people about big data, data artichitecture, data engineering, and career advice. Always happy to speak at meetups or company knowledge sharings about the things I'm working on. More info in the [Contact](/contact/) section.
