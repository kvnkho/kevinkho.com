I am always happy to chat about anything remotely data related! I can specifically help with:

* contracting around big data platforms, and self-serve analytics (especially around [Fugue](https://github.com/fugue-project/fugue/)).
* speaking about my work at meetups, company lunch and learn, or informal chats
* reviewing conference proposals
* career advice or portfolio advice for people breaking into the data industry

I am also specifically looking for opportunities around being an adjunct lecturer at a university, or creating courses around big data.
