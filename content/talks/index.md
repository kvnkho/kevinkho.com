title: Talks and Tutorials

Most of my conference talks are about workflow orchestration with [Prefect](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect) and working with big data using [Fugue](https://github.com/fugue-project/fugue/). I am always happy to give any of these talks at meetups or internal company events.
