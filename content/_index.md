Hi! My name is Kevin and I currently spend most of my time working on [Fugue](https://github.com/fugue-project/fugue/) and around distributed computing. This site is a collection of my blogs and talks. If you find anything interesting, I am always willing to give a talk at a meetup or company event.

For work, I currently am a part-time contractor for [Citi](https://www.citi.com/). I am looking for more contract work around distributed computing (Spark, Dask, Ray) and compute platforms (both for self-serve analytics and machine learning).
