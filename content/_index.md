Hi! My name is Kevin and I currently work as an AI Engineer at [Drata](https://drata.com/), applying AI towards the compliance industry. I also maintain [Fugue](https://github.com/fugue-project/fugue/), a unified interface for distributed computing. This site is a collection of my blogs and talks. If you find anything interesting, I am always willing to give a talk at a meetup or company event.
