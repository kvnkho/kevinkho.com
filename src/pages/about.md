# About

## Kevin Kho

I'm a **Senior AI Engineer at Drata** (via the Harmonize acquisition), based in Los Angeles, CA.

I build data infrastructure and AI systems that help teams work more efficiently. My work focuses on distributed computing, workflow orchestration, and applying AI to solve real business problems.

## Background

Previously, I was an **Open Source Community Engineer at Prefect**, where I helped developers build reliable data pipelines and contributed to the workflow orchestration ecosystem.

I'm also a co-author of **Fugue**, an open-source project that provides a unified interface for distributed computing across Spark, Dask, and Ray. Fugue enables data teams to write code once and run it on any backend without code changes.

## Technical Interests

- **Distributed Computing**: Scaling data processing with Spark, Dask, and Ray
- **AI/ML Systems**: Building production-ready AI infrastructure
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Designing reliable data pipelines
- **Developer Experience**: Making complex tools accessible

## Speaking & Teaching

I regularly speak at conferences including PyCon and SciPy, and have created courses on distributed computing and data engineering for platforms like O'Reilly.
