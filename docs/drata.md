# Drata

**Senior AI Engineer** | [Website](https://drata.com)

## Overview

Drata is a security and compliance automation platform that helps companies achieve and maintain compliance with frameworks like SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and GDPR.

I joined Drata through the acquisition of Harmonize, where we built AI-powered tools for compliance automation.

## Current Work

As a Senior AI Engineer, I focus on:

- **AI-Powered Automation**: Building systems that automate compliance workflows using AI
- **Data Infrastructure**: Designing scalable data pipelines for compliance monitoring
- **ML Systems**: Developing and deploying machine learning models in production

## The Challenge

Compliance is traditionally a manual, time-consuming process:

- Companies spend thousands of hours gathering evidence
- Security teams manually review controls and policies
- Audits require extensive documentation preparation

## Our Approach

We apply AI and automation to:

- Automatically collect and organize compliance evidence
- Intelligently map controls to framework requirements
- Reduce manual effort while improving accuracy

## Impact

Helping companies:

- Reduce time spent on compliance by orders of magnitude
- Maintain continuous compliance rather than point-in-time audits
- Scale security programs without proportionally scaling headcount
