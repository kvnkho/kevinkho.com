## O'Reilly Courses

I've created educational content for O'Reilly Media covering distributed computing and data engineering topics.

### Topics Covered

- **Introduction to Fugue**: Building portable distributed applications
- **Data Engineering Best Practices**: Patterns for building reliable data pipelines

## Conference Workshops

I regularly run workshops at conferences including:

- **PyCon**: Hands-on distributed computing tutorials
- **SciPy**: Data science at scale workshops
- **DataTalks.Club**: Community presentations on data engineering

## Teaching Philosophy

My approach to education focuses on:

- **Practical examples**: Real-world problems over toy examples
- **Progressive complexity**: Start simple, then layer in advanced concepts
- **Framework-agnostic thinking**: Understanding principles over memorizing APIs
