## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I break into data science or AI in 2026?**
A: Focus on visibility before ability. Build artifacts (GitHub repos, blog posts, talks) that showcase your work. The bar is higher than ever, but one or two sprints of focused effort can put you in the 84th percentile.

**Q: What's the difference between Fugue and just using Spark directly?**
A: Fugue lets you write code in native Python/pandas syntax and execute it on Spark, Dask, or Ray without rewriting. It's for teams who want to scale pandas code without learning Spark APIs.

**Q: Should I learn Spark or stick with pandas?**
A: Start with pandas. Only move to Spark when you hit scale limits. Fugue can help bridge the gap when that time comes.

**Q: What makes a portfolio project impressive in 2026?**
A: Projects that show you understand the hard parts—evaluation, reliability, failure modes, edge cases. Anyone can build a demo. Show that you understand what happens when things go wrong.
