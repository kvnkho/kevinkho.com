From Hugo to Framer to Docusaurus in a month.

<!-- truncate -->

As someone who codes, I've always leaned towards static site builders that let me write blogs in Markdown. My last personal website was on [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), and it worked fine until it didn't. The theme I was using had issues with newer Hugo versions and I couldn't even make simple updates. Classic open-source maintenance story.

So I decided to try something different. I'd always wanted to experiment with Framer—less code, more visual editing, maybe I'd actually write more content instead of tinkering with configs. Plus I had access to the [Framer MCP](https://github.com/aaroncox/framer-mcp), which was genuinely cool to see in action. Watching Claude interact with Framer's API to build pages was a neat demo of where things are heading.

But Framer's CMS left a lot to be desired. The editing experience was clunky. The content was trapped behind their interface. And I was paying for it.

Then I read two posts that changed my thinking. First was Prefect's [Rebuilding Our Website for the Agent Era](https://www.prefect.io/blog/rebuilding-our-website-for-the-agent-era), where Adam Azzam made a point that stuck with me: "Your AI assistant can see the code but not the content." When your content lives in a CMS, there's a wall between your AI tools and what you actually want to edit. Second was Lee Robinson's [post about agents](https://leerob.com/agents), where he moved cursor.com off their CMS back to markdown. His argument was simple—abstractions have never been more expensive when working with AI agents.

Both of them were right. I wanted Claude Code to be able to edit my blog posts directly. No CMS layer, no API calls, no logging into a separate system. Just markdown files in a git repo. I can draft a post on my phone, push it, and have it live. Or I can tell Claude Code to fix a typo and it just does it.

So I migrated again. This time to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), which is what I should have done from the start. It's markdown-based, actively maintained, and deploys free on Render. No more paying for Framer. The migration itself was straightforward—Claude Code handled most of the heavy lifting.

The other thing that pushed me to finally do this was Eric Ma's [blog post](https://ericmjl.github.io/blog/2025/12/25/two-years-of-weekly-blogging-and-what-2025-taught-me/) about writing a blog post every week for two years straight. The consistency was inspiring. I don't expect anyone is eager to read what I have to write. But seeing Eric post consistently about AI reminded me that despite AI still being so experimental, it's increasingly hard to find content about half-baked experiments, or even better, failures. LinkedIn is more filtered than ever. If anything, I hope to at least document some of the unsuccessful things I've tried.

I previously wrote mostly about [Fugue](https://github.com/fugue-project/fugue), the open-source project I was working on. Fugue is still maintained, but I've done a lot more since then that I never added to my website. Time to fix that.
