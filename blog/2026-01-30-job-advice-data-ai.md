I get a lot of questions from new grads about how to break into data and AI on LinkedIn. I try my best to respond, and at the peak of it I'd have 2-3 people I was actively mentoring with bi-weekly check-ins. Over the years, I've watched dozens of people go through this process - some land roles quickly, others struggle for months. Most actually fall out of talking to me pretty quickly once I give harsh advice. They'd rather hear there are some external factors preventing them from getting a job. That's not helpful for anyone. Those who stick with it and are willing to do the work normally succeed. It takes commitment.

**A caveat before we start:** if you're an international candidate trying to break in, a lot of this is harder and some of it is out of your control, especially with the current political climate. I don't have great advice there other than to acknowledge that it's genuinely harder, and that really sucks.

## The Bar is Rising Fast

I must say, I was confident in my advice until recently. Times have changed, and advice from someone who recently went through the grind might be more relevant than mine. I've seen the same dance throughout the last 6 or 7 years, but recently it's been unpredictable given the economic and political situation, plus advancements in AI.

When I got my first data science job around 2016, the bar was pretty reasonable: an engineering master's degree and the ability to code. I started doing research at the US Geological Survey writing scripts for analysis. Simple scripts by today's standards.

The bar has changed a lot since then. This is super rough and debatable but I think gets the point across:

| Era       | What Made You Stand Out                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2016-2019 | Can you code and learn ML algorithms (engineering background)? |
| 2019-2022 | Deployment: Docker, cloud, CI/CD, data drift                  |
| 2021-2023 | Modern data stack: dbt, Snowflake, orchestration, APIs        |
| 2023-2024 | A RAG project                                                 |
| 2025      | Agent implementation                                          |

Notice how the cycles are getting shorter? It used to be 3-year windows. Now it feels like 1 year or less. I'm not entirely sure what I'd recommend as a portfolio project right now. A year ago, building your own RAG chatbot was impressive. Today, that's trivial to spin up.

This is what makes staying current exhausting. It's not that the work is hard - it's that the goalposts keep moving. Even experienced professionals fall out and have to upskill. I've seen senior people take a long time to land something post-layoff. You need a long-run mentality about this.

That said, some things still hold true.

## The 1 Standard Deviation Rule

Here's a way to think about it: if your resume fell in a pile of 10 applications, what are the chances yours would come on top? If you're average, chances are pretty bad because there will be 4-5 people ahead. But if you invest just a little bit of time to improve, you can be one standard deviation above the mean. That's the 84th percentile. That increases the odds tremendously, and it's totally achievable. After that, it might be a bit of diminishing returns.

Most people settle for median. They do the bare minimum - take a course, update their resume, and start applying. A bit more effort goes a long way.

We're in the golden age of tutorials. There are so many options that you can find an instructor whose style resonates with you. That's amazing. But here's the thing: all your peers have access to the same resources. Everyone's taking the same courses, following the same tutorials. So what are you doing that goes beyond what everyone else is doing?

One thing to be aware of: we tend to rate our own ability higher than it actually is. It's like the [study](https://www.tobii.com/lp/why-most-drivers-think-they-are-above-average) where up to 80% or more rate themselves as above average drivers. When applying for the first role, I think people don't really know what average is, and it's an always moving target.

## Ability vs Marketability

There's a difference between ability and marketability. You need both to get a job, but a lot of people get this backwards. I see folks grinding leetcode before they've even gotten a single interview. If you're not getting interviews, the problem probably isn't your coding skills - it's your visibility.

Think about it: between a candidate who's an amazing coder but has no public portfolio, versus a decent engineer with a great portfolio, the one with the portfolio is more likely to get the job. They're visible. Recruiters can find them. Hiring managers can see their work.

**Only optimize for ability when you are getting interviews but failing them.**

## Gaining Visibility

So how do you become visible? Pick a lane and own it:

1. **Chase the frontier** - Stay on top of the latest AI trends. Agents, new frameworks, cutting-edge techniques. 

2. **Go deep in a tech niche** - Become the Spark expert, the PyTorch specialist, the Kubernetes person. Less glamorous but consistent demand.

3. **Domain specialization** - Focus on biology, real estate, sports, finance. Combine tech skills with deep domain knowledge.

Something to consider though: some niches are doubly hard to break into.

## Conclusion

There's no magic bullet here. The number of people wanting to enter data and ML has far exceeded the number of openings. It's competitive. The bar is higher than it's ever been.

But I don't think it's out of reach. Not at all.

One mindset thing: try not to think "man, these people who got in earlier aren't even that good." You might be right! But it's not a helpful thought. It doesn't change anything. You're not competing with the people who already have jobs - you're competing with the other applicants for the same role.

The opportunities are still there. The bar is higher, but so is your potential to clear it.
